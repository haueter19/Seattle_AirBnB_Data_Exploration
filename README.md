# Seattle_AirBnB_Data_Exploration
### Udacity Data Science Nanodegree Program

#### Purpose
To explore the Seattle AirBnB dataset, generate questions, and answer those questions using data science techniques.

### Prereqs
<ul>
  <li>Python 3</li>
  <li>Jupyter Notebook</li>
  <li>Sklearn</li>
  <li>NLTK</li>
  <li>Pandas</li>
</ul>

### How To
<ul>
  <li>Make sure to install packages</li>
  <li>From command line: git clone https://github.com/haueter19/Seattle_AirBnB_Data_Exploration.git</li>
  <li>jupyter notebook</li>
</ul>

### Files
<ul>
  <li>listings.csv - csv with data related to listings/hosts</li>
  <li>calendar.csv - csv with data related to price and availability by date</li>
  <li>reviews.csv - csv with comments of reviews</li>
  <li>Blog Post.ipynb - data exploration and attempts to answer questions</li>
</ul>

### Questions to answer
1. What can we learn about the availability of listings?
2. How does asking price change?
3. What are common features of superhosts?
4. What factors contribute to price?

### Summary
After exploring the data, it was discovered that there are seasonal changes in the availability and price of the listings. Common features of superhosts are quick responses and higher reviews. An attempt to build a model to predict price returned some ability to predict prices. However, it more work/data is needed to improve the model.
